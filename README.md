# Ag Market Simulation Game

A lightweight, web-based simulation game exploring real-world agricultural economics, behavioral lags, and the friction between micro (farm) and macro (global trader) silos. 

Built entirely via modular vanilla JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## File Architecture
- `index.html` — Main UI, setup screen, and result console.
- `style.css` — Mobile-friendly styling.
- `main.js` — The central game conductor and UI event listener.
- `historical_data.js` — Real-world historical shock factors and baseline data.
- `engine.js` — The core economic math (asset risk, labor vs. infrastructure weight, and cobweb lags).

## How to Play
1. Choose your **Silo** (Micro Farm Manager vs. Macro Trader).
2. Select a historical **Start Year** (e.g., 2007, 2020, 2022).
3. Allocate your **Asset Risk %** and your **Structural Weight** (Labor-heavy vs. Infrastructure-heavy).
4. Run the simulation to see how systemic market lags and historical outcomes impact your capital.
